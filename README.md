# Apriori Algorithm
Apriori algorithm is an influential algorithm that is generally used in the field of data mining & association rule learning. It is used to identify frequent itemsets in a dataset & generate an association based rule based on the itemsets.
The Apriori algorithm is based on the notion of support. The steps of the algorithm are:
Compute the support for each individual item.
Decide on the support threshold.
Select the frequent items.
Find the support of the frequent itemsets.
Repeat for larger sets.
Generate association rules and compute confidence.
Compute lift.
